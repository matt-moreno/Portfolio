        <h1>Product Owner</h1>
        <p>
          As a Product Owner II at Dubsado, I lead the development and delivery
          of the Form Builder and Scheduler features, which enable users to
          create and manage customized forms and appointments for their clients.
          I collaborate with the engineering, design, and marketing teams to
          define the product vision, roadmap, and backlog, and to ensure the
          quality and usability of the features. I have a BA in Political
          Science Administrative Studies: Management Information Systems from
          the University of California, Riverside, where I learned the
          fundamentals of database management, web development, and business
          administration. I also have a strong background in customer success,
          having worked as a customer success professional at Dubsado for a year
          before becoming a product owner. I am passionate about creating
          positive customer experiences and solving complex problems with
          innovative solutions. I am currently enrolled in Coursera's Data
          Analytics course to enhance my product decisions with data-driven
          results.
